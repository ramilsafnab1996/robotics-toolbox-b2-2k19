## Prerequisites

Follow the link to the [Robotics Toolbox official website](https://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox) to get instructions on how to install it.

**Note.** Install Robotics Toolbox with version 10.3.1.

In short, there are two ways to install Robotics Toolbox:

**Note.** You are already provided with Robotics Toolbox in MATLAB toolbox format (see [`Libs`](/Libs) folder).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ramilsafnab1996/robotics-toolbox-b2-2k19.git
```

or, alternatively, you can download it as a [zip-archive](https://github.com/ramilsafnab1996/robotics-toolbox-b2-2k19/archive/master.zip).
